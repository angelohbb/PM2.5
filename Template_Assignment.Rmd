# Part 1 - Identify a Social Problem

Use APA referencing throughout your document. [Here's a link to some explanation.](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/apa-citation-guide/)

## 1.1 Describe the Social Problem

Air pollution is a serious environmental and public health issue in Europe. One of the most harmful pollutants is PM2.5—fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers. These particles can enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream, increasing the risk of asthma, heart disease, stroke, and premature death (WHO, 2021).

In our project, we focus on comparing Eastern and Western Europe to see if there are major differences in both PM2.5 pollution levels and the mortality rates caused by long-term exposure. This comparison is relevant because the two regions differ in industrialization, environmental policies, and healthcare systems—all of which can influence air quality and health outcomes.

We used two datasets: one showing average PM2.5 levels across countries, and one reporting death rates related to PM2.5 exposure. Our aim is to understand how air pollution affects public health in different parts of Europe and where improvements are most needed.

# Part 2 - Data Sourcing

## 2.1 Load in the data

Preferably from a URL, but if not, make sure to download the data and store it in a shared location that you can load the data in from. Do not store the data in a folder you include in the Github repository!

```{r loading_data}

```

midwest is an example dataset included in the tidyverse package

## 2.2 Provide a short summary of the dataset(s)

```{r}
head(dataset)
```

In this case we see 28 variables, but we miss some information on what units they are in. We also don't know anything about the year/moment in which this data has been captured.

``` r
inline_code = TRUE
```

These are things that are usually included in the metadata of the dataset. For your project, you need to provide us with the information from your metadata that we need to understand your dataset of choice.

## 2.3 Describe the type of variables included

Think of things like:

-   Do the variables contain health information or SES information?

-   Have they been measured by interviewing individuals or is the data coming from administrative sources?

*For the sake of this example, I will continue with the assignment...*

# Part 3 - Quantifying

## 3.1 Data cleaning

Say we want to include only larger distances (above 2) in our dataset, we can filter for this.

```{r data_cleaning}
mean(dataset$percollege)
```

Please use a separate 'R block' of code for each type of cleaning. So, e.g. one for missing values, a new one for removing unnecessary variables etc.

## 3.2 Generate necessary variables

Variable 1

```{r gen_var1}

```

Variable 2

```{r gen_var2}

```

## 3.3 Visualize temporal variation

```{r}

```

## 3.4 Visualize spatial variation

```{r visualise_map}

```

Here you provide a description of why the plot above is relevant to your specific social problem.

## 3.5 Visualize sub-population variation

What is the poverty rate by state?

```{r visualise_subpopulations}
dataset$inmetro <- dataset$inmetro %>% as.factor()
# Boxplot of poverty rate by state using the 'midwest' dataset
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = inmetro, y = percadultpoverty)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Poverty Rates by Metropolitan status (Midwest counties)",
    x = "Metropolitan Area",
    y = "Poverty Rate of Adults (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```

Here you provide a description of why the plot above is relevant to your specific social problem.

## 3.6 Event analysis

Analyze the relationship between two variables.

```{r analysis}

```

Here you provide a description of why the plot above is relevant to your specific social problem.
